          <p>Ladies 
            of Harley ( L.O.H. ) is a program sponsored by the Harley Owners Group to 
            support women motorcycle enthusiasts (both drivers and passengers). It is 
            not a separate organization within H.O.G., but was established to encourage 
            women to become more active in H.O.G. and their local chapters.</p>
  
          <p>Ladies of Harley membership allows you to paticipate in all the L.O.H. activities 
              at various H.O.G. rallies and events. (These may include workshops, seminars, 
              photos, and other special events.)</p>
              
          <p>When you register for L.O.H., you will receive an embroidered patch and 
            a pin. Each time you renew, you will receive a pin indicating the year of 
            membership. You will be identified as a registered L.O.H. member by having 
            the letters LOH on your H.O.G. card.</p>

          <p>The only requirement for membership is that you must be a member of the 
            Harley Owners Group. L.O.H. membership is free to active H.O.G. members. 
            To join, call 1-800-CLUB HOG or go to their <a class="outbound" title="National H.O.G. Website" href="http://www.hog.com" target="_blank">website</a>. </p>
