            <h2>What is the Harley Owners Group?</h2>
            <p>The Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) is an organization founded and sponsored by the Harley-Davidson Motor Company.
             The group was established to offer motorcycling benefits and services to Harley-Davidson enthusiasts throughout the world, 
             and develop a close relationship between the Harley-Davidson rider, the Harley-Davidson dealer and the Harley-Davidson Motor 
             Company.</p>
            <p>Each chapter is sponsored by the local dealer and is offered to bring members together for the common interest of promoting 
            motorcycling activities. The chapters are family oriented and nonpolitical.</p>
